NEED TO RUN FOR
- cesm2.2.2
- cesm2.2.1
- cesm2.1.5
- cesm2.1.4 have issues with checkout externals so could try https://bb.cgd.ucar.edu/cesm/threads/github-changes-will-require-updates-to-cesm2-x-tags.9022/ or just copy 2.1.5


# UPDATES
comptag is now grabbed via get_git_tag "git describe --exact-match --tags" from the nmlfile directory instead of command line

not sure how to get the compversion via the script 


# GETTING CESM
git clone -b release-cesm2.1.4 https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM.git .
./manage_externals/checkout_externals -o
